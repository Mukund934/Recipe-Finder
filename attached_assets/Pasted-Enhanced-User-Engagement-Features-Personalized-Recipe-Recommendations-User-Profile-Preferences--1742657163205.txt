Implementation Considerations
Modular Component Design:
Each of these features should be broken down into modular, reusable React components, making your codebase maintainable and scalable.

Performance and Optimization:
As you add more dynamic and interactive features, consider optimizing API calls, lazy-loading components, and using caching mechanisms where possible.

User Feedback Loop:
Implement features like in-app surveys or feedback forms so users can share their thoughts on the new features. This iterative feedback loop can guide further enhancements.

Security and Data Privacy:
When storing user data (profiles, preferences, and history), ensure that you’re following best practices for security, such as encryption, secure authentication (e.g., JWT), and compliance with privacy regulations.
